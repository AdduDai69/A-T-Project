This project is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game implemented in the C programming language. The game uses a 3×3 board represented by a 2D character array, where players take turns entering the row and column to place either ‘X’ or ‘O’. The program displays the board after every move, checks for winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals, and also identifies when the game ends in a draw. Additionally, it keeps track of the score of both players across multiple rounds and allows the players to continue or exit based on their choice.

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, arrays, and functions, making it a useful learning exercise for beginners. The structure is simple and user-friendly, focusing on logical flow and clarity. While it does not include computer-based AI or graphical elements, it provides a strong foundation that can be expanded into more advanced game versions, including single-player AI mode or graphical user interface gameplay.

Example Gameplay:

   |   |  
---|---|---
   |   |  
---|---|---
   |   |  

Player X, enter row and column (0-2): 1 1

   |   |  
---|---|---
   | X |  
---|---|---
   |   |  

Player O, enter row and column (0-2): 0 2

   |   | O
---|---|---
   | X |  
---|---|---
   |   |  

... (game continues until win or draw)
